## Personal Website
I built this website to let people know just a little bit about me. It was developed using React and Node.js.

## Setup
1. Clone or fork project.
2. Install required dependencies with `yarn`.
3. Remove or set `homepage` in `package.json` to single dot. 
4. `yarn start` to run locally or `yarn deploy` to build/deploy to github-pages.

## Inspiration
